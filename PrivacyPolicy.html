        <h1>Privacy Policy — HouseWork</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 14-08-2025</p>

        <p>HouseWork ("we", "us") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains the information we collect, why
            we collect it, and how we use and share it.</p>

        <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Registration data:</strong> first name, last name, mobile number, role (household or helper).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Address:</strong> full address and geolocation coordinates (longitude, latitude) provided during
                signup or when creating requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Request data:</strong> task details, date/time, price, task-specific fields and any optional
                notes you provide in a request.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> device identifiers, crash logs, analytics and push-notification tokens
                (Expo push token) to deliver notifications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How we use your data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide and improve the platform (matching requests, showing requests to helpers in proximity).</li>
            <li>To verify accounts via OTP and to prevent abuse and fraud.</li>
            <li>To share contact details between matched parties so they can coordinate the service.</li>
            <li>To collect platform commission and cancellation fees using a third-party payment processor (e.g.,
                Razorpay) when applicable.</li>
            <li>To send operational messages and push notifications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. When we share information</h2>
        <p>We only share the minimum information necessary to facilitate the service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When a helper accepts a request, we share the household's contact and address with the helper, and the
                helper's contact with the household.</li>
            <li>Third-party service providers (hosting, analytics, push notifications, payment processors) process data
                on our behalf under contract.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Payments &amp; financial information</h2>
        <p>In v1, the primary job payment is handled offline between the household and helper. For platform commissions
            and cancellation fees we will use a payment provider (for example Razorpay). We do not store raw payment
            card data on our servers; payment processors handle payment credentials subject to their own policies.</p>

        <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
        <p>We retain personal data as long as necessary to provide the service and comply with legal obligations.</p>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect personal data. However no system is entirely risk-free.
            Please use good practices (e.g., keep your device secure).</p>

        <h2>7. Your rights</h2>
        <p>You may request access to your personal data, correction, or deletion by contacting us at
            prempatel01248@gmail.com. We'll respond in accordance with applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Children</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for persons under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>

        <h2>10. Delete account</h2>

          </a>
        </p>

        <h2>9. Changes</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. We will post the updated policy with a new effective date. Continued use
            after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
