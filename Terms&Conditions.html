        <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions — HouseWork</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 14-08-2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to <strong>HouseWork</strong> (“we”, “us”, “the App”). These Terms &amp; Conditions ("Terms")
            govern your use of the App and related services. By using the App you agree to these Terms. If you do not
            agree, please do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Services overview</h2>
        <p>HouseWork connects households (people requesting household tasks) with helpers (service providers).
            Households post tasks with date, time window, tasks, and price. Helpers can view nearby requests and accept
            those they wish to perform. After a helper accepts a request, the App shares contact details so the parties
            can coordinate directly.</p>

        <h2>2. Roles &amp; eligibility</h2>
        <p>The App supports two roles: <strong>Household</strong> and <strong>Helper</strong>. You must be 18 years or
            older to use the App. You agree to provide accurate information at registration and to update it when
            necessary.</p>

        <h2>3. Payments, commission &amp; cancellation fees (v1)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary payments between household and helper:</strong> In this first release, households pay
                helpers directly (cash, UPI, bank transfer, etc.). The App does not process the main job payment.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform commission:</strong> Helpers agree to pay a commission on earnings for jobs
                accepted/completed via the App. The current commission rate is <strong>10%</strong>. We may change the
                commission rate; changes will be posted in the App and on our website or policy pages.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancellation fee:</strong> If an accepted request is cancelled by either party, a cancellation
                fee equal to <strong>10%</strong> of the request price may be applied. This rate can be updated by us.
                For v1 the App records and manages these fees (and will charge via the chosen payment flow when
                enabled).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How we collect commission and cancellation fees</h2>
        <p>When you accept services of or through the App, you consent to the collection of applicable commissions and
            cancellation fees by the App operator. Commission and fees are implemented using a payment provider (for
            example, Razorpay). By using the App, you authorize us to collect amounts due for commission/penalties as
            described in these Terms.</p>

        <h2>5. Contact information sharing</h2>
        <p>Contact and address details are shared only for the purpose of coordinating the requested service: when a
            helper accepts a request, the household's address and mobile number are shared with the helper, and the
            helper's contact details are shared with the household.</p>

        <h2>6. Job verification</h2>
        <p>After accepting the task, app will generate an OTP/PIN for identity verification between helper and
            household.
            Successful verification is used to mark a job as confirmed and eventualy completed in the App.</p>

        <h2>7. Refunds, disputes and offline payments</h2>
        <p>Because the main job payment is handled outside the App (offline) in v1, refunds or disputes regarding the
            job payment must be resolved between the household and helper directly. For disputes related to
            commission/penalty collection or platform actions, contact <strong>prempatel01248@gmail.com</strong> and we
            will review as per our policies.</p>

        <h2>8. User conduct</h2>
        <p>Users must behave lawfully and respectfully. Fraudulent, abusive, or illegal conduct may result in warnings,
            suspension, or termination of access to the App.</p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>HouseWork is a platform connecting households and helpers. We are not the employer of any helper and do
            not provide or guarantee the performance of services. To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for
            loss, damage or injury arising from the acts or omissions of users, or for the quality of services delivered
            by helpers.</p>

        <h2>10. Delete account</h2>
        <p>To request account deletion, please fill out and submit the form at the following link:

          </a>
        </p>

        <h2>11. Changes to these Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post changes on this page and indicate the effective
            date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
